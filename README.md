# CSE Admission Data Visualization

This project visualizes admission data from the department of Computer Science and Engineering. It uses Sankey diagrams to display the flow of students through the admission process. Users can apply filters to select and compare groups of students.

## Team Members

1. Sachin Mehta
2. Sam Crow
3. Wesley Lee

## Breakdown

Include:

- Wesley was in charge of initial storyboarding and data analysis
- When coding up the visualization, Sachin focused on Sankey Diagram Visualization while Sam focused on filter design
- Development process
 - 10 hour (data collection/discussion/Analysis with Stuart and Alex)
 - 3 hours storyboarding
 - 22 hours on setting up filters
 - 20 hours on setting up the Sankey Diagram
 - 15 hours on integrating the code (including bug fixes)
 - 14 hours tinkering with the design
Due to our inexperience with JavaScript and less familirity with D3, the most time consuming part was coding up the first draft of our visualization (one sankey diagram with 2-3 filters)
